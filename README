Finite Differences Toolbox
==========================

This small software package contains all tools which are needed to use 
Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) for calculation of magnetic, 
dielectric, and magnetoelectric response properties of simple materials.

The methodology for these calculations is described in the following
