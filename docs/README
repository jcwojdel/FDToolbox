0. INTRODUCTION AND PREREQUISITIES

The METoolbox set of python programs allows for calculation of the following physical properties:

- Gamma-point phonons
- elastic constant tensors
- Born charges
- piezoelectric tensors
- electric susceptibility tensor 
- piezomagnetic tensors
- lattice mediated magnetic susceptibility tensor
- magneto-electric coupling tensor

General workflow for getting the above attributes is as follows:

1) Find the groundstate of the system
2) Generate slightly perturbed POSCARs from the groundstate CONTCAR (generate_poscars.py)
3) Run all the necessary calculations for all of the generated POSCARs
  a. Single point energy, forces and stress evaluation:
     needed for all calculations
  b. Three Berry phase calculations for each integration direction:
  	 needed for calculations from Born charges and further
  c. Single point non-colinear magnetic state evaluation:
  	 needed for calculations from piezomagnetic tensors and further
  	 note that this calculation supercedes (a), so you need to do only one of them
4) Run relevant programs on the directory containing subdirectories with all calculations from step 3.
  - elastic constants - elastic.py
  - Born charges, piezoelectric, electric susceptibility tensors - piezo.py
  - piezomagnetic, electric susceptibility tensors - piezom.py
  - magneto-electric coupling tensor - me_coupling.py

In order to use METoolbox you need:

- python 2.5 or newer
- numPy 1.2 or newer (Numerical Python)
- VASP 4.6 or newer
- VASP compiled for noncolinear magnetism for magnetic response calculations
- lot's of CPU time 

1. GENERAL REMARKS ON COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS

Initial geometry for the studied system can come from any type of VASP calculation, or even from the 
crystallographic data. METoolbox does not rely on the structure being an equilibrium one, but of course
the quality of results will depend on it strongly.

For calculations of Born charges, one does not need to care much about the accuracy of the calculations;
general rules for VASP calculations apply here.

For calculations of anything related to the elastic constants, the geometry should be optimised very well,
as should the energy. Note that the convergence of the calculated stress tensor is much slower than the
convergence of forces, positions, and energies. Therefore a high energy cutoff and good k-point sampling
is needed.

Experience shows that all Berry-phase calculations can be done at colinear level, even if the system 
itself exhibits important physics at spin-orbit coupling level. METoolbox copes with mixing both colinear
and noncolinear calculations in the same calculation set, so this is an advisable optimisation of the 
computational load.

For the magnetic response calculations, one needs to be aware of the fact that noncolinear magnetism 
converges extremely slowly. Tiny differences in spin-canting are stabilised only at EDIFF=1e-7, and for
some systems even at EDIFF=1e-9 level of convergence. It extremely important to start each calculation 
from the same guess of the magnetic state, and just specifying MAGMOM is usually not enough. Typically, 
this can be achieved by starting from the same WAVECAR obtained from the groundstate calculation. 
Otherwise (if storing WAVECAR is impossible), one can use ICHARG=1 and restart from the same CHGCAR. In 
this case, it is crucial to allow for a long non-selfconsistent run at the beginning of calculation, so
that all randomness of the initial wavefunction is smoothed out (NELMDL=15 or more).

Things _will_ go wrong. In a compound with 10 atoms in the unit cell, one has to run more than 300 
calculations. So at least some of them are likely to fail. Be sure to check that the restarts were done 
with the same setting as the rest of the runs, CHGCARs were not overwritten, parameters changed etc.

2. GENERATING POSCARS

Once we have the groundstate geometry, we can use generate_poscars.py to populate the current directory 
with subdirectories containing perturbed POSCAR files. A typical run looks like this:

$ generate_poscars.py CONTCAR 0.005 0.02                                                                                               
calc_00_0                                                                                                 
calc_01_+1                                                                                                
calc_01_-1                                                                                                
calc_01_+2                                                                                                
(...)
calc_04_-2
calc_04_+3
calc_04_-3
calc_00_a+X
calc_00_a-X
calc_00_a+Y
(...)
calc_00_c+Z
calc_00_c-Z

generate_poscars.py prepared directories calc_ATOMNUM_[+/-]DIRECTION with POSCARS containing specific 
atom moved by 0.005 angstrom in both directions along x,y,z (1,2,3) Cartesian axes, and 
calc_AXISNAME[+/-]DIRECTION with lattice distortions in which given axis was moved by 0.02 angstrom in
both ways of each Cartesion direction.

generate_poscars.py takes three parameters:

- name of the input file (usually POSCAR or CONTCAR)
- ionic displacement in angstroms
- axis vector displacement in angstroms

both of the displacement parameters can be specified as a triplet of numbers, allowing for nonhomogeneous 
displacements, e.g.:

$ generate_poscars.py CONTCAR "0.005 0.001 0.002" "0.01 0.02 0.05"

Note the quotation marks around each triplet. This may be especially useful for unit cell distortions of
a system which is significantly elongated along one of the directions. In case one wants to generate only
ionic (axis) displacements, the other parameter can be set to 0:

$ generate_poscars.py CONTCAR 0 0.01

will generate only unit-cell axis distortions.

Note that the naming convention is not crucial for proper working of the METoolbox. One can change the 
directory names almost arbitrarily. Also, the displacement directions can be different, even 
inhomogeneous, as long as they span the whole space of possible distortions. The set of distortions 
generated by generate_poscars.py is overcomplete (contains movement in + and - directions) for the sake
of computational stability. However, for quick and dirty calculations, one could use just the half of 
generated POSCARs (e.g. the + direction and calc_00_0 = groundstate). The only thing that is needed is 
that the ionic and unit cell distortions are kept separate and can be distinguished by name. The naming
convention generated by this program is used for for separating ionic and unit cell distortions in all 
other programs of the package, but it can be quickly changed; see the following lines of code:

cs=calculation_set.read_directory(directory, saxis, usecache)
cs.set_ionic('.*/calc_.._.*[0123]')
cs.set_lattice('.*/calc_00_...')
cs.set_groundstate('.*/calc_00_0')


3. RUNNING ALL CALCULATIONS

The subdirectories containing POSCARS should be copied to the machine on which the calculations are run. 
Of course, running all of them by hand, copying appropriate INCARs, POTCARs, KPOINT files would be a 
daunting task, so it's better to prepare some scripts doing this automatically. One example set of scripts
like this for CESGA's Finis Terrae is included in this directory.

Note that in the end, METoolbox expects that in each directory it will find the following files:

OUTCAR
OUTCAR_berry_1
OUTCAR_berry_2
OUTCAR_berry_3
 
all of them may be compressed using standard gzip command (OUTCAR.gz etc.)

OUTCAR should contain the single point calculation from which forces, stresses and magnetization will 
be read, and OUTCAR_berry_* should contain Berry phase calculations for corresponding IGPAR direction.

4. RUNNING METOOLBOX

After all the calculations have been done, one can copy the results to some directory, and run any of the 
provided programs. All of the programs take as the first argument the top-level directory name and start 
reading from all its subdirectories. The programs calculating magnetic properties take as the second
parameter the SAXIS orientation noted as "X/Y/Z" for example:

$ me_coupling.py BiFeO3_100 1/0/0

As reading of the OUTCARs takes most processing time, all programs will try to first use already cached 
data from DIRECTORYNAME_pickled.dat file. In this manner, only first of the run programs will actually 
read the contents of the subdirectories, all other will just read (100x faster) the pickled file with 
all the data. If rereading of the subdirectories is needed, one can either remove *_picled.dat file, or 
use optional argument "nocache" as the last argument given to the program.

In this directory you may find the ZnO.tar.gz archive which contains all OUTCARs needed to calculate 
piezoelectric properties of ZnO. You can run some programs on it and familiarise yourself with the 
output:

$ tar xvzf ZnO.tar.gz 
ZnO/calc_00_0/OUTCAR                                      
ZnO/calc_00_0/OUTCAR_berry_1                              
(...)

When running METoolbox for the very first time on a given dataset, it is very useful to set the logging 
level to the highest possible setting. In this way, you'll be able to spot any problems with your 
calculations (and with METoolbox). This can be done by adding the following line at the beginning of the 
program:

loggable.log_level=LOG_ALLINFO

Things that typically go wrong:

1) Atoms jumping out of the unit-cell and appearing at the other end. This should in principle be 
corrected by "try_fix_displacements()" call, but bugs are likely. One can monitor this by looking at 
displacements printed out for each read calculation; none of them should be "large".

2) Quantum of polarization issues. This will be present for sure if (1) is present, but also in case of 
highly symmetric geometries, in which case the Berry phase strings tend to be -0.5 or 0.5, leading to
unexpected jumps. Again, "try_fix_polarizations()" should take care of it, but things are likely to go 
wrong. This will be visible at the level of polarization differences which are printed out.

3) Accuracy of forces (stresses) might be to low to properly reproduce 3x near-zero eigenvalues of
force constant (clamped ion elastic) matrix. In case, when inversion of any of those matrices results in
a number of soft modes different than 3, a warning is issued. Note that sometimes, we might want to have
matrix with such properties - in case of specific constraints on lattice, the translational (rotational) 
invariance might be lost.

5. HACKING METOOLBOX

While METoolbox provides four useful programs for calculating interesting physical properties, much more
can be done by quick hacks to the code. See the following examples located in additional_tools directory:

- generate_phonon.py - can be used to generate an ARC file with animation of a specific phonon
- mixup.py - shows how to mix two different sets of calculations in order to approximate results (in this 
  case we transfer magnetic properties of the BFO to BFO thin film at 6% strain)
- me_constrained.py - shows how to impose constraints on unit cell distortions, so that properties of
  strained films can be calculated
